Euler method can be expressed as follows: 
$$y_n = y_{n-1}+h\frac{\partial y_{n-1}}{\partial x_{n-1}},$$
where $h$ is the step size. The function can be expressed in an iterative form:
$$y_n = y_{1}+h\frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{1}}+h\frac{\partial y_{2}}{\partial x_{2}}+\cdots+h\frac{\partial y_{n-1}}{\partial x_{n-1}}$$

Residual function is given by
\begin{align*}
	h_{t+1} = h_{t}+f(h_{t}, \theta).
\end{align*}
The $h$ is iteratively updated as follows:
\begin{align*}
	h_{2} &= h_{1}+f(h_{1}, \theta)\\
	h_{3} &= h_{2}+f(h_{2}, \theta) = h_{1}+f(h_{1}, \theta)+f(h_{2}, \theta)\\
	\vdots
\end{align*}
These iterative update can be seen as \textit{discretization} of the \textit{continuous} transformation of Euler method as the residual function is done by discrete steps. Note that this is the key contribution of this approach.
